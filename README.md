# K-Means_Clustering



## K-Means Clustering on Customer Dataset

This project demonstrates the application of the K-Means clustering algorithm on a customer dataset. The K-Means algorithm is implemented in two ways: using libraries and from scratch. The performances of these two implementations are then compared.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a "Customer Segmentation Dataset" obtained from Kaggle. It includes features such as customer age, spending score, etc.

## Implementation

The K-Means algorithm is first implemented using libraries. This serves as a benchmark for the implementation from scratch. The algorithm implemented from scratch follows the standard procedure of the K-Means algorithm. It includes initialization of centroids, assignment of data points to the nearest centroid, and updating of centroids.

## Detailed Explanation

Since there are two distinct notebooks, detailed explanation of their implementation and performance is provided in the respective notebooks.
